  <h2>What is Python?</h2>
  <p>Python is general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented and high level programming language. Python is called high level language 
     because it writes hardware independent code (those programing language writes hardware dependent code called low level programming languages). 
     As it is general purpose language, because it can make any kind of general purpose software.<br/> It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985-1990.
     Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL)</p>
  
  <h4>Some popular applications in python:-<br/></h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Youtube</li>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>Dropbox</li/>
  <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
  <li>Instagram</li>
  <li>Quora</li>
  <ul>

  <h4>Lets take  an example of "Hello World' using Python</h4>
  <h5>>>>print("Hello world")    
  <p>The Output is:<p>
  <h5>Hello World</h5>

  <h2>Why Python?</h2>
  <p>The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated like other language. Due to
   its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.</p>
  <h2>Features of Python<h2>
  <h4>A. Python is Object-Oriented:-</h4>
  <p>Python supports Object Oriented Programming(OOP) concept that encapsulate code within objects. All concepts in OOPs like data hiding, operator overloading, inheritance 
     etc. can be well written in Python.<p/>
  <h4>B. Simple and easy-to-learn:-</h4>
  <p>Python is a simple language with few keywords, simple structure and its syntax is also clearly defined. This makes Python a beginner's language.<p/>
  <h4>C. Interpreted and Interactive:-</h4>
  <p>Python is processed at run time by the interpreter. We need not compile the Program before executing it. The Python prompt interact with interpreter to interpret the programs 
     that you have writen.</p>
  <h4>D.Extendable:-</h4>
  <p>You can alsoadd low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable Programmer to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient. It can be easily 
     integrated with C,C++,Java,COM,ActiveX,and COBRA</p>
  <h4>E. Dynamic:-</h4>
  <p>Python provides very high-level dynamic data typed and supports dynamic type checking. It also supports automatic garbage collection.</p>
  <h4>F. GUI Programming and Database:-</h4> 
  <p>Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many libraries and windows systems, such as Microsoft foundation Classes(MFC), Macintosh, and the 
     X Windows system of Unix. Python also provides interfaces to all major commercial database.</p>
  <h4>G. Portable:-</h4>
  <p>Python can run on a wide variety of hardware and software platforms and has the same interface on all platforms. All variants of Windows, Unix, Linix and Macintosh
     are to name a few.</p>
  <h4>H. Scalable:-</h4>
  <p>Python provides a better structure and support dfor large Programs that shell scripting. It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to 
      bytecode(intermediate code that is platform independent) for building large applications.</p>
  <h4>I. Broad Standard Library:-</h4>
  <p>Python's library is portable and cross platform compatible on UNIX, Linix, Windows and Macintosh. This helps in the support and development of a wide range
     of applications from simple text processing to browsers and compiex games.</p>

  <h2>Keywords</h2>
  <p>Keywords are the reserved words anf its meaning cannot be change. Keywords cannot be a variable name. There are 33 leywords in Python 3.3 To retrieve the
     keywords in Python the followinf code can be given at the prompt. The Keywords True, False and None are in Uppercase and rest are in lowecase. /p>  
  <h5>>>> import keyword<br/> >>> print(keyword.kwlist) </h5>
  <h5>['False', 'None', 'True', '__peg_parser__', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except',
    'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']</h5>

  <h2>Identifiers</h2>
  <p>A Python identifiers is a name used to idetify a variables, functions, class, module or any other object. Python is case sensitive and hence uppercase and lowercase 
     letters are considered distinct. The following are the rules for naming an identifier in Python.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase(a to z) or uppercase(A to Z) or digits(0 to 9) or an underscore(_). For example- Python and python is different.</li>
  <li>Reserved keywords cannot be used as an identifier.</li>
  <li>Identifiers cannot begin with a degit. For example 2lower, 3lower etc are invalid identifiers.</li/>
  <li>Special symbols like- !,@,#,$,%,^ etc. cannot be used in an identifiers. For example #name, @ram etc. are invalid identifiers.</li>
  <li>Identifiers can be of any length.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p>Variables are reserved memory locations to store values. Based on the data type of the variable, the interperter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.
     Therefor, by assigning different types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.<br> Python variables do not need explicit declaratoion to
     reserve memory space. The decleration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign(=) is used to assign values to variables. The operand to the left
     of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. </p>
  <h4>Example Program</h4>
  <h5>a=100 # an integer assignment<br/>b=500.0 # an floating point<br/>name="Ram" # A string<br/>print a<br/>print b<br/>print name</h5>
  <p>Here, 100, 500.0, "Ram" are the values aassigned to a,b and name variable, respectively. Hence the output of the code is:-</p>
  <h5>100<br/>500.0<br/>Ram<br/></h5>
  <p>Python also allows you to use a single value to several variables simultaneously. For example-<p/>
  <h5>a=b=c=1</h5>

  <h2>Comments in Python</h2>
  <p>Comments are very important while writing a program in any language. It describes what a source code has done. Comments are just for Programmers for better understanding pf a program.
     In Python, we use a single(#) symbol to start writing a comment.</p>
  <h5>Example Program</h5>
  <h5>>>>print("Hello")    # Demonstration of Hello program</h5>
  <p>This result is:<p>
  <h5>Hello</h5>
